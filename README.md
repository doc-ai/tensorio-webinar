This repository contains all the files and example projects needed to reproduce the contents of the Tensor/IO webinar given on Jan 21, 2021.

## Colab

The notebook in this directory can be run as-is in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). It will build the model that is used in the iOS and Android demo apps and download its saved model contents to your filesystem.

Open the notebook in Colab directly from GitHub by choosing File > Open Notebook, selecting the GitHub tab, entering this repository's URL (https://github.com/doc-ai/tensorio-webinar) and then choosing the colab/tensorio_demo.ipynb notebook that Colab finds.

## iOS

An iOS application with the prebuilt model from the Colab notebook already included. Demonstrates how to run the model in an iOS application.

## Android

An Android application with the prebuilt model from the Colab notebook already included. Demonstrates how to run the model in an iOS application.
